Error at Line 12, Column 11:
   Implicit loss of numeric precision
      'int' inferred from the assignment to variable 'x' on Line 12, Column 11
      'decimal<1>' inferred from literal '0.5' on Line 12, Column 7
   Possible fixes:
      • round the higher precision expression to match the lower precision
      • use types with more (e.g. arbitrary) precision
