Type error at Line 1, Column 48:
   Expected: 'text' inferred from literal '"bar"' on Line 1, Column 48
   But got:  'num' inferred from use of binary operator '/' on Line 1, Column 36

Type error at Line 2, Column 23:
   Expected: 'set<int>' inferred by top level definition for variable 'bar' on Line 2, Column 23
   But got:  'set<account>' inferred from a set expression on Line 2, Column 23

Type error at Line 2, Column 24:
   Expected: 'account' inferred from the return type of the function 'sender' on Line 2, Column 24
   But got:  'int' inferred from use of binary operator '-' on Line 2, Column 34

Error at Line 2, Column 36:
   Implicit loss of numeric precision
      'int' inferred from use of binary operator '-' on Line 2, Column 34
      'decimal<2>' inferred from literal '3.14' on Line 2, Column 41
   Possible fixes:
      • round the higher precision expression to match the lower precision
      • use types with more (e.g. arbitrary) precision
