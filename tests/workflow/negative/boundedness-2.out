Workflow soundness errors:
• One-boundedness violation. Applying transition 'transition initial -> {p1, p2}' to state '{initial, p1}' would result in an illegal state where the following place occurs more than once: 'p1'.
• One-boundedness violation. Applying transition 'transition p1 -> initial' to state '{initial, p1}' would result in an illegal state where the following place occurs more than once: 'initial'.
• One-boundedness violation. Applying transition 'transition initial -> {p1, p2}' to state '{initial, p2}' would result in an illegal state where the following place occurs more than once: 'p2'.
• One-boundedness violation. Applying transition 'transition p2 -> initial' to state '{initial, p2}' would result in an illegal state where the following place occurs more than once: 'initial'.
• Dead-end state: '{initial, p1}'.
• Dead-end state: '{initial, p2}'.
