Workflow soundness errors:
• One-boundedness violation. Applying transition 'transition eitherSet -> terminal' to state '{eitherSet, terminal}' would result in an illegal state where the following place occurs more than once: 'terminal'.
• Improper completion at merge-site. When merging the results of two AND branches, more specifically terminal and eitherSet , the resulting state contained the terminal place while containing other places as well.
