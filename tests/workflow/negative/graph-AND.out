Workflow soundness errors:
• One-boundedness violation. Applying transition 'transition {xIsSet} -> {eitherSet}' to state '{eitherSet
                                                                                                ,xIsSet}' would result in an illegal state where the following place occurs more than once: 'eitherSet'.
• One-boundedness violation. Applying transition 'transition {yIsSet} -> {eitherSet}' to state '{eitherSet
                                                                                                ,yIsSet}' would result in an illegal state where the following place occurs more than once: 'eitherSet'.
• Improper completion. Applying 'transition {eitherSet} -> {terminal}' to state '{eitherSet
                                                                                 ,xIsSet}' would result in the new state '{xIsSet
                                                                                                                          ,terminal}' where the terminal place is reached while other places are still active.
